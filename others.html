				<p>
					Of course, I don't only work in life. Here are other activities, hobbies and sports I do with my free time.

					<a class="grand"><strong>Video Games and Series</strong></a>
					<p>
						Playing video games and watching series aren't activities people dare to talk professionally about.
						Nevertheless, I can't skip them because, and especially for video games, they are the most important part of my activities.
						Also, these activies are not worse than the other ones : you can learn with the story of a series or a game, and video games can train your cognitive skills.
						Over the top, video games are the reason I got first interested in computer science, but also in other domains.

					<a class="grand"><strong>Drawing and Writing</strong></a>
					<p>
						During the 2 years of preparatory class, I wasn't able to draw or write because I was working very hard.
						However, now that it's over, I can draw and write again.
						Of course, I read so that I get inspiration to write.

				<div>
					<a class="grand"><strong>Table Tennis and Badminton</strong></a>
					<p>
						I may not be a great player, but I still have a lot of fun practicing these sports.
						I have mostly played Table Tennis during primary and middle school, and Badminton during high school and preparatory class.
						Nowadays, I practice Badminton during PE and Table Tennis at home.
